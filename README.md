### -*Adding a new third party*-

It was difficult at first to understand the concept of adding a new api like this one to my code and referencing it. With the help of OpenWeathermaps easy to understand docs; I was able to parse through and find the help I needed. Now what ever city you choose the corresponding weather will be displayed.

### Learning Curve

The difference this project has from others I have done in the past is that did most of the css from memory of previous projects. This meant that I had to return over and over again to change things and edit styling until the final product was pleasing for me to look at. This helped build my confidence and was a reminder that although I have learned alot, I am still only just beginning my journey as a web developer.

Below is a screenshot of the finished product and the css code side by side!
